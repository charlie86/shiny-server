For my submission to Ari Lamstein's R Shapefile Contest, I looked at Twitter's sentiment towards Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Using Twitter's geotagging feature, I mapped current sentiment expressed in tweets across the United States and examined the effect of the Democratic National Convention on tweet sentiment.

## Database architecture
The tweets, henceforth referred to as twitts, are stored on a MySQL database I have on an AWS RDS instance. I have a script (included at the bottom of the post) hosted on EC2 to pull down live twitts mentioning Clinton or Trump's Twitter handles using the `streamR` package (I begain tracking the evening of Monday, July 25th, 2016).

Before writing the twitts to the database, I use `httr` and the US Census API to reverse geocode the twitts for which lat/lon tracking is enabled (around 3% of all twitts). Additionally, I use `tidytext` to count the number of "positive" and "negative" words for each twitt and detect which candidate the twitt refers to. In cases where both candidates are mentioned, I do not calculate sentiment.

While this specific application does not require streaming twitts (The `twitteR` package is great for pulling in past twitts), I built the infrastructure for a `shiny` app I'm working on to monitor real-time sentiment.

## Load up
```{r load up, warning = F, message = F}
library(chuckr) # package for pulling from my MySQL database
library(RMySQL)
library(DBI)
library(scales)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(highcharter)
```

## Twitter candidate sentiment by state
```{r pull states}
twitts_og <- chuckr::cQuery("SELECT 
        candidate,
       `State.name` AS state_name,
        avg(positive - negative) AS score
       FROM twitts
        WHERE candidate IS NOT NULL
        AND `State.name` IS NOT NULL
       GROUP BY 1,2")
```
To quantify sentiment, I took the mean difference in positive and negative words for each candidate per state. To compare states' candidate preferences, I then took the differences in the candidates' scores within states. 
```{r}
twitts <- twitts_og %>%
    spread(candidate, score, fill = 0) %>% 
    mutate(diff = round(Clinton - Trump, 2),
           name = state_name)
```
To create the map, I used jbkunst's `higcharter` package, which comes preloaded with U.S. geojson files.

States with positive values tend to have more positive language when tweeting about Clinton than Trump and are colored blue, while states with negative values are in red, indicating relatively more postive tweets for Trump.
```{r}
data("usgeojson")
highchart() %>% 
    hc_add_series_map(
        usgeojson, twitts,
        name = "Tweet Score", value = "diff", joinBy = "name") %>% 
    hc_colorAxis(dataClasses = color_classes(breaks = c(-1, 0, 1), colorRampPalette(c('#E91D0E', '#232066'))(3))) %>% 
    hc_legend(layout = "vertical", align = "right", floating = TRUE)
```
Using almost identical code, I further broke it down to the county level. However, because I had less than a week of data, and such a small portion of twitts were geotagged, the map is fairly empty.

One note here is that sparsity of the county level data led to more extreme values. Because all I looked at was whether or not the differences in scores were positive or negative, I normalized the scores to fit within negative and positive one.
```{r}
county_twitts_og <- cQuery("SELECT 
       candidate,
        `County.FIPS` AS fips,
        avg(positive - negative) AS score
       FROM twitts
        WHERE candidate IS NOT NULL
        AND `County.FIPS` IS NOT NULL
       GROUP BY 1,2")

county_twitts <- county_twitts_og %>%
    mutate(score = rescale(score, to = c(-1, 1))) %>% 
    spread(candidate, score, fill = 0) %>% 
    mutate(diff = round(Clinton - Trump, 2))

highchart() %>% 
    hc_add_series_map(
        uscountygeojson, county_twitts,
        name = "Tweet Score", value = "diff", joinBy = "fips") %>% 
    hc_colorAxis(dataClasses = color_classes(breaks = c(-1, 0, 1), colorRampPalette(c('#E91D0E', '#232066'))(3))) %>% 
    hc_legend(layout = "vertical", align = "right", floating = TRUE)
```
Here we see a more balanced breakout of Trump vs Clinton sentiment. With national polls being so tight at the moment, the overwhelmingly blue state map could be due to Clinton's "convention bounce", as the DNC was this week. To further explore this, I took a look at the overall sentiment over time. For interpretation's sake, I again normalized the score to fit within negative and positive one.
```{r}
stuff <- cQuery("SELECT
        concat(date(created_at), ' ', hour(created_at), ':00') AS time,
        candidate,
        # avg(positive - negative) * count(*) AS score
        count(*) as score
        FROM twitts
        WHERE candidate IS NOT NULL
       GROUP BY 1,2")

stuff_plot <- stuff %>% 
    mutate(time = as.numeric(as.POSIXct(time) - hours(4)) * 1000) %>% #,
           # score = round(rescale(score, to = c(-1, 1)), 2)) %>% 
    arrange(time)
hchart(x = time, y = score, group = candidate, type = 'spline', object = stuff_plot) %>% 
    hc_xAxis(type = 'datetime', labels = list(
    format = '{value:%m-%d-%Y}'
)) %>% 
    hc_yAxis(max = 1, min = -1)
```
There definitely appear to be spikes in Clinton's sentiment during the primetime DNC events! Specifically, Michelle Obama's midnight speech on Monday, the roll call vote ending at 7pm on Tuesday, Barack Obama's speech at midnight on Wednesday, and Hillary's formal acceptance speech midnight Thursday.

To fully analyze the effect of the DNC will require more data. After a few more weeks of collecting twitts, I will revisit this analysis and compare the past four nights to the candidates' typical sentiment fluctuation.

Below is the script I use to pull in twitts and write them to RDS (apologies for the lack of comments).
